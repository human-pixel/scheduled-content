## Schedule Selected Content allows you to schedule any content, in any post, to show at a time you set in the future.

And it's brilliantly easy to use. Choose to make certain post or page content available only at scheduled periods including:

*   Onetime - Choose a date in the future to start showing the content
*   Weekly - Show your content only on certain days of the week at a given time
*   Monthly - Schedule your content to display on the same day each month

There's even an awesome countdown timer that reloads the page at the beginning and end of the scheduled period to help enforce the protection. Simply install and activate using the [WPMU DEV dashboard](http://premium.wpmudev.org/project/wpmu-dev-dashboard/) and a nice new 'Schedule' icon will be added to your Visual editor that you can use to schedule selected content.

 Find a new icon in the content editor

 Simply select what sections of your content you want to schedule, when it's to be released and how long the content should be available.

 Enter anything like to display prior to the content being released

 Easily use it for videos, audio, competitions or any other kind of media you like. Now your users, readers or students will only be able to see what you want to display at the scheduled time.
